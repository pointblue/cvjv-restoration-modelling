This folder contains the models for bird forecasting in California's Central Valley.  Each of the four subfolders is for a species.  Within the subfolders are four model objects:

[Four-letter species code]_[N/S]_[model]_[datelastmodified]

Each forecast involves an ensemble of a prediction using a model created only with northern data (models denoted “N”) and only southern data (models denoted “S”).  Thus, there are two model objects for each prediction. 

There are also two models “Realtime” and “Longterm”.  The “Realtime” for the ducks amends the TYPE of realtime model “FloodedCover”.
